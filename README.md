# Latina Women in German Higher Education
# ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project analyzes the migration of Latina women into German higher education over the last 10â€“15 years. While Latina women in Latin America are enrolling in tertiary education at unprecedented levels, their representation in Germany remains limited. Using official data sources, I explore enrollment trends, country of origin, fields of study, scholarships, and future forecasts.

The goal is to provide insights that can support universities, policymakers, and scholarship providers in designing more inclusive, targeted programs.

# Research Questions

Supply â€“ How many Latina women pursue higher education in Latin America?

Bridge â€“ How many make the leap to Germany, and through which scholarships (DAAD)?

Equity â€“ Which countries dominate, and which remain underrepresented?

Clustering â€“ Once in Germany, which fields of study and degree levels attract Latina women the most?

Future â€“ What are the key trends, and how many students can we expect in the next 5 years?

# Data Sources

Destatis (Statistisches Bundesamt) â€“ Official German enrollment statistics (foreign vs German students, fields, degree levels).

DAAD (Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst) â€“ Scholarship data for female international students from Latin America.

World Bank â€“ Tertiary education enrollment ratios for Latin American countries.

# Methods

Data cleaning and harmonization using Python (Pandas/Polars).

Integration of multiple datasets (countryâ€“year level).

Time-series forecasting using Tableau Forecast (5-year outlook).

Visual storytelling via an interactive Tableau dashboard.

# Dashboard Highlights

Trend & Forecast: Latina enrollment in Germany (2013â€“2028).

Scholarships vs Enrollment: Absolute vs relative DAAD allocations.

Equity View: Latinas as % of total foreign female students.

Clustering: Top fields of study and degree breakdowns.

Geography: Country of origin with interactive filters.

# Key Findings

Latinas are strongly represented in higher education at home, but remain only ~2% of foreign female students in Germany.

Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay dominate scholarships in absolute numbers, but smaller countries like Panama and Belize show higher relative mobility.

Latinas cluster in business, medicine, and management, but also show a growing presence in STEM fields.

Forecasts suggest steady growth in enrollment over the next 5 years, but scholarships are not keeping pace.

Most Latinas only arrive for graduate studies, highlighting barriers at the undergraduate level.

# Next Steps / Policy Implications

Expand scholarships to underrepresented Latin American countries.

Build stronger partnerships between German and Latin American universities.

Design programs that target undergraduate women, especially in STEM fields.
